Index file:
The index file instinctively allows me to create a class as mentioned before in class, assigning the csv files certain roles within my code.


Input file:
The input file allows my code to bring in and read the certain input csv files within my code to produce the output


Output file:
The output file allows my code to read the class I made in the index file, brings in and reads the input file I created in the input file and lastly produces a code below all of that to generate specific outputs to each csv output that was given to us by you.


Hope you like it, thank you!
