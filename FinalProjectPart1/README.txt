Index file:
The index file instinctively allows me to create a class as mentioned before in class, assigning the csv files certain roles within my code.


Input file:
The input file allows my code to bring in and read the certain input csv files within my code to produce the output


Output file:
The output file allows my code to read the class I made in the index file, brings in and reads the input file I created in the input file and lastly produces a manual entry code to allow for the entering of manufacturer and item type to search for whatever is in inventory of the csv files that are given to us from you.


Hope you like it, thank you!
